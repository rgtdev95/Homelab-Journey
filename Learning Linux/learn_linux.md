# Linux Learning Summary

## What is Linux?
- **Operating System**: Software that manages hardware and lets applications run
- **Kernel**: The core component that sits between hardware and software
- A complete Linux system includes: kernel + system libraries + GUI + utilities + applications

## History
- Created by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991 as a student
- Wanted Unix for his PC but it cost $5,000
- Built from scratch (not a Unix copy)
- Version 1.0 released in March 1994
- **Open source**: Free to use, modify, and share

## Linux Distributions (Distros)
A distro = Linux kernel + collection of software

**What Makes Each Distro Different:**
- Pre-installed software (web browsers, utilities, etc.)
- Default configurations and settings
- Package management systems
- Support models

**Note:** You can always change/install different software - distros are just curated collections that work well together.

### Choosing a Distro for Your Career

**Top 2 Industry Distros:**
1. **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**
   - For large traditional organizations (finance, healthcare, government, telecom)
   - Requires license (free for up to 16 systems for individuals)
   - **Free alternatives:** AlmaLinux or Rocky Linux (identical to RHEL, just rebranded)
   - **Note:** CentOS Stream is now a preview/beta of RHEL (not a clone anymore)

2. **Ubuntu**
   - For startups, web companies, SaaS businesses, cloud computing
   - Completely free
   - Popular in modern tech companies

**Key Insight:** Linux is Linux at the core - concepts are the same across distros. You can't make a wrong choice!

## Why Use Linux?

**Advantages:**
- Runs on almost any hardware (phones, PCs, servers, supercomputers)
- Small footprint (works on old/embedded systems)
- **Stable, reliable, and secure**
- **Free** (no licensing fees in most cases)
- Many free applications available
