# Coder

Compose in repo: `Docker Compose/coder-compose.yml`

Upstream docs/repo: https://coder.com/docs and https://github.com/coder/coder

Notes
- I used the default Coder compose from the repo. Coder can use various backing services; review the compose file for database or storage requirements and connect it to the central PostgreSQL if desired.
